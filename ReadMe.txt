Implementation details:
- The code is in C# and .NET 6
- A controller for the statement is created.
- MediatR is implemented to communicate between controller and service
- A Global Exception middleware is included as part of the code
- Dependency injection is used 
- Comments are written for all public object
- Option pattern is implemented for Configuration
- Solution is running on docker container
- Only default HttpLogging is added to to explain my intent. Concrete logging mechanism requires more information about actual deployment details
- Two tests cases are written when the file is present and not to show my intent
- UI is not implemented as it is optional and I understand it requires React Native, on which I didn't work yet
